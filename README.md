## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to spend more time on the crossplay between hover vs. focus/active states (i.e., doing one thing when you mouse over and then two different things when you mouse away based on whether you've clicked the element or not).
